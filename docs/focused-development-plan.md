# AutoProHub Focused Development Plan (Remaining Items)

## Overview
This focused development plan addresses the critical gaps identified in the audit of the existing prasso_api Laravel codebase. The foundation infrastructure is already 70% complete, so this plan focuses exclusively on the missing AutoProHub-specific features.

**Current Status:** 35-40% of full platform complete
**Existing Foundation:** Laravel 11, multi-tenancy, authentication, Filament admin, messaging package (80%), basic project management
**Target:** Complete core AutoProHub functionality in 6-8 months
