---

## Technical Debt & Recommendations

### Architecture Considerations
1. **Package Integration:** Current packages are loosely coupled - consider tighter integration
2. **Database Design:** Some tables may need refactoring for AutoProHub-specific workflows
3. **API Consistency:** Standardize API response formats across packages

### Development Recommendations
1. **Start with Customer Management** - Foundation for all other features
2. **Implement Booking System Next** - Core business functionality
3. **Build Work Order Integration** - Connect customer ‚Üí booking ‚Üí work order flow
4. **Add Mobile-First Design** - Critical for field technicians

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Leverage Existing Messaging** - Use for customer notifications and reminders
2. **Extend Project Management** - Adapt for work order tracking
3. **Utilize Site Builder** - Create customer-facing booking portals

## Estimated Development Timeline

Based on current foundation and missing components:

- **Phase 2 (Customer Management):** 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Booking/Scheduling):** 8-10 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Operations):** 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 5 (Financial Enhancement):** 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 6 (Online Presence):** 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 7 (Mobile/Advanced):** 8-12 weeks
- **Phase 8 (Launch):** 4-6 weeks

**Total Estimated Time:** 42-58 weeks (10-14 months) from current state

---

## Conclusion

The prasso_api application provides an excellent foundation with robust multi-tenant architecture, authentication, and several integrated packages. However, AutoProHub-specific features are largely missing, requiring focused development on customer management, booking systems, and operational workflows.

**Recommendation:** Begin with customer management as the foundation, followed by booking/scheduling system to establish core business functionality before expanding to advanced features.
